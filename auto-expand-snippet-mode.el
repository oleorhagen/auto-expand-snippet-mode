;; Installation
;; ============
;;
;; Copy auto-expand-snippet-mode.el to your load-path and add to your .emacs:
;;
;;     (require 'auto-expand-snippet-mode)
;;     (auto-expand-snippet-mode)
;;
;; Restart Emacs and customize auto-expand-snippet-mode with
;;

;; Usage
;; =====
;;
;;
;;; A simple minor-mode for automatically expanding snippets, expanded by a
;;; prefix , (comma), and then the snippet name. Expanded once the first space
;;; after the pattern is found.
;;
;;; Real handy for quickly expanding snippets you use a lot.
;;
;;

;; Tested with Yasnippet, and ert,
;; using Emacs versions 29.x

;;; Code:

(require 'thingatpt)
